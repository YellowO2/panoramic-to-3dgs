# SHARP_360_to_Splat

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bafbdace-d01e-431f-84a7-c2403a0c2c33

SHARP_360_to_Splat is a Windows desktop workflow for turning stitched 2:1 equirectangular 360 panoramas into Gaussian splat outputs using Apple's SHARP model.

It wraps the full process in a GUI with source browsing, preview, batch selection, optional preprocessing, optional SeedVR2 upscaling, optional DA360 depth alignment, and export to standard or compressed splat formats.

This project expects already-stitched panoramas exported from tools such as Insta360 Studio. It does not ingest raw `.insp` files directly.

## What It Does

- Loads stitched 2:1 panorama images from a folder browser
- Optionally preprocesses the panorama with ImageMagick before slicing, including a blur-safe preset for motion-blurred footage
- Optionally applies motion deblur to extracted faces before SeedVR2 and SHARP
- Optionally sharpens and upscales extracted faces with SeedVR2 before SHARP prediction
- Optionally aligns SHARP depth scale against DA360 panorama depth
- Merges all predicted view splats into one final output
- Exports `.ply`, `.spx`, `.spz`, or `.sog`

## Main Features

- GUI file browser with preview and source-folder workflow
- Multi-select batch processing from the file list
- `Ctrl+A` support in the file list to select all panoramas in the current folder
- Windows Send To integration: send one or more images to the launcher and open the GUI with them preselected
- Clickable output paths in the log and completion dialog
- Optional automatic Temp workspace cleanup after processing
- Optional repo-managed ImageMagick install under `third_party/ImageMagick`
- Blur-safe ImageMagick preset tuned for shaky capture and motion blur
- Optional motion deblur on extracted faces before SHARP inference
- Optional SeedVR2 face upscaling with settings exposed in the GUI
- Optional DA360-based depth normalization for cross-view scale consistency

## Supported Inputs

- `.jpg`
- `.jpeg`
- `.png`
- `.heic`
- `.webp` in the GUI browser when Pillow can read it

Input panoramas must be stitched equirectangular images with a 2:1 aspect ratio.

## Supported Outputs

- `.ply`
- `.spx`
- `.spz`
- `.sog`

Compressed exports require `gsbox.exe`.

## Quick Start

1. Install Python 3.13.
2. Install Git for Windows.
3. Run `Setup_NewPC.bat`.
4. Start `SHARP_360_to_Splat.exe` or `!Launch_SHARP_360_to_Splat.bat`.
5. Choose a source folder with stitched panoramas.
6. Select one image or multi-select several images in the file list.
7. Click `Run Pipeline`.

For release packages, `SHARP_360_to_Splat.exe` is a lightweight launcher. It does not bundle `torch`, CUDA wheels, or the full runtime stack into the EXE itself. Instead, those dependencies are installed into the local `.venv` by `Setup_NewPC.bat`, either ahead of time or on first launch.

The standard setup now asks whether SeedVR2 should be installed. A separate beginner profile is also available through `Setup_Beginner_NoSeedVR2.bat`, which installs CPU-only torch, skips SeedVR2, and skips the automatic DA360 checkpoint download.

## Setup Details

`Setup_NewPC.bat` prepares a local portable-style environment for this repo.

It will:

1. Detect Python 3.13
2. Create or reuse `.venv`
3. Install PyTorch either with CUDA 12.8 or in CPU-only mode
4. Install the vendored `ml-sharp` package in editable mode
5. Install core runtime extras and optionally clone or update `seedvr2_videoupscaler`
6. Download and install ImageMagick into `third_party/ImageMagick`
7. Download the default DA360 checkpoint into `checkpoints/DA360_large.pth`
8. Create a Windows Send To shortcut for SHARP_360_to_Splat

Supported setup flags:

- `--dry-run`
- `--skip-checkpoint`
- `--skip-seedvr2`
- `--with-seedvr2`
- `--cpu-only`
- `--with-cuda`

If you run `Setup_NewPC.bat` without flags, it now prompts for the torch profile and whether SeedVR2 should be installed.

## GUI Workflow

The main window is built around a source-folder browser.

- Pick a source folder
- Select one or more panoramas from the file list
- Review the preview and output hint
- Configure format, device, and optional processing features
- Run the pipeline for the current selection

Batch behavior:

- When multiple files are selected, each image is processed independently
- Each result is written beside its source image using the pattern `<source_stem>_merged.<format>`
- The log shows progress per file and exposes clickable output paths

Temp behavior:

- By default the Temp workspace is deleted automatically after processing
- If `Keep intermediate face images and per-face splats` is enabled, Temp cleanup is disabled automatically
- If an intermediate directory is configured, batch runs create a per-image subfolder inside that location

## Send To Integration

`Setup_NewPC.bat` creates a Windows Send To shortcut.

After setup, you can:

1. Right-click one or more supported panorama images in Explorer
2. Choose `Send to -> SHARP_360_to_Splat`
3. The launcher opens the GUI with those images already selected in the file list

The batch launcher `!Launch_SHARP_360_to_Splat.bat` forwards incoming file arguments directly to the GUI.

## ImageMagick Integration

ImageMagick is handled as a repo-managed third-party tool instead of being committed into Git.

- Setup installs it under `third_party/ImageMagick`
- Runtime prefers that local copy before PATH lookup
- The GUI auto-detects `magick.exe`
- Panorama preprocessing is controlled by explicit GUI toggles instead of one raw command string

Current ImageMagick operations exposed in the GUI:

- Preset selector (`blur_safe`, `classic`, `custom`)
- Auto level
- Auto gamma
- Normalize
- Enhance
- Despeckle
- Unsharp mask
- Extra args

The default preset is now `blur_safe`, which keeps tone/contrast recovery but disables `Enhance` and `Despeckle` because those two filters often make motion-blurred footage look worse.

## Deblur Preprocessing

An optional motion-deblur stage can run on extracted faces before SeedVR2 and SHARP.

- It uses Richardson-Lucy deconvolution with an automatically selected motion angle.
- It operates on the face luminance channel and blends the restored result back into the original color image.
- Strength can be set to `low`, `medium`, or `high` in the GUI.

This is meant to help with real capture blur from camera movement. It will not fully recover detail lost to severe motion smear, but it is materially different from simple sharpening.

## Face Extraction

Perspective faces keep the panorama-derived vertical coverage by default instead of collapsing to a square crop.

- face width is derived from the horizontal slice span plus configured overlap
- face height is derived from the panorama height
- `Cut-off Height` removes the configured percentage symmetrically from the top and bottom of each extracted face
- the extraction camera now uses separate horizontal and vertical handling so tall rectangular faces remain valid through SHARP, DA360 projection, and export

## SeedVR2 Integration

SeedVR2 is not vendored into the main repository. Setup clones it from its upstream repository and installs its runtime dependencies locally.

If SeedVR2 support was skipped during setup, enabling SeedVR2 in the GUI will now fail with a direct message telling you to rerun setup with SeedVR2 enabled or disable the option.

In the GUI you can enable face upscaling before SHARP prediction and configure key SeedVR2 parameters such as:

- model
- `Equalize proportions via SeedVR2` to temporarily square non-square faces before the upscaler runs
- `Pre-upscale downscale factor` to intentionally reduce the SeedVR2 input size before reconstructing detail
- `min resolution` and `max resolution` in normal mode
- `max resolution` only in equalized mode
- batch size
- offload settings
- compile backend and mode
- VAE tiling

Current SeedVR2 sizing rules:

- with `Equalize proportions via SeedVR2` disabled, the face keeps its aspect ratio and the final longest side is clamped to the configured `min resolution` and `max resolution`
- with `Equalize proportions via SeedVR2` enabled, the shorter side is expanded to match the current longest side before the SeedVR2 run, and only `max resolution` is used as the final cap
- `Pre-upscale downscale factor` affects the temporary SeedVR2 input only; the final target size is still derived from the original extracted face size so the output does not stay downscaled

The equalize option is a true non-uniform resize used only as a temporary SeedVR2 preprocessing step. It does not pad or crop the image.

## DA360 Alignment

DA360 is used as an optional panorama-wide depth reference.

When enabled, the pipeline predicts DA360 panorama depth, projects that reference into each extracted SHARP view, and aligns SHARP's per-view scale accordingly. This helps produce more consistent merged geometry across views.

The default checkpoint path is `checkpoints/DA360_large.pth`.

## Overlap Alignment

As an alternative to DA360, the GUI now supports an `overlap` alignment mode.

In this mode, adjacent face splats are compared directly inside their shared overlap band. The pipeline first solves per-face and per-seam scale corrections from the raw SHARP face splats, then runs a second refinement pass on the clipped seam splats to standardize depth layers and reduce residual edge offsets before the final merge.

This is useful when DA360's global depth prior is not fitting the local face geometry well enough.

## Build

Run `build_exe.bat` from a machine where the local `.venv` already exists.

The build script:

1. Installs PyInstaller into the local environment
2. Builds a lightweight `SHARP_360_to_Splat.exe` bootstrap launcher
3. Assembles a standard release folder under `release_pkg/`
4. Assembles a smaller starter release folder under `release_pkg/`
5. Copies the Python source files and vendored `ml-sharp` tree required by setup/runtime
6. Bundles DA360 assets and optional extras only into the standard package
7. Creates zip archives for distribution

The packaged EXE intentionally does not embed `torch`, `torchvision`, `torchaudio`, CUDA wheels, or the rest of the heavy Python runtime payload. Those are installed locally by `Setup_NewPC.bat` on the target machine.

Release packages also do not bundle ImageMagick anymore. Setup installs it locally when needed.

The starter package also avoids bundling DA360 assets, the DA360 checkpoint, and the viewer payload. It ships a beginner `Setup_NewPC.bat` wrapper that defaults to CPU-only torch and no SeedVR2.

- `gsbox.exe` is required for `.spx`, `.spz`, and `.sog`
- Input panoramas must be stitched before they enter this workflow

## Troubleshooting

### ImageMagick setup fails

- Run `Setup_NewPC.bat` again
- Check that GitHub API access and GitHub release downloads are reachable
- If needed, browse manually to `magick.exe` in the GUI

### DA360 checkpoint missing

- Re-run `Setup_NewPC.bat`
- Or browse manually to a DA360 checkpoint in the advanced settings
- Or disable DA360 alignment

### Compressed output fails

- Confirm `gsbox.exe` exists next to the app or is selected in the advanced settings

### GUI opens from Send To but nothing is selected

- Re-run `Setup_NewPC.bat` so the Send To shortcut is recreated
- Make sure you are using the current launcher or rebuilt executable
